# SplitWise - Expense Tracker Backend

A production-ready Split Expense Tracker backend API built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. Similar to Splitwise, this application helps groups split expenses fairly and calculates optimized settlements.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Expense Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete expenses
- **Automatic Person Tracking**: People are automatically tracked when mentioned in expenses
- **Settlement Calculations**: Smart algorithms to minimize the number of transactions needed
- **Multiple Split Types**: Equal split, percentage split, and exact amount split
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- **Real-time Updates**: Live dashboard with expense statistics

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database (or use the provided DATABASE_URL)

### Local Development

## Deployment

- Backend: [https://split-wise-hhst.onrender.com](https://split-wise-hhst.onrender.com)
- Database: NeonDB (cloud-hosted)

## Known Limitations

- Only supports group-based settlements (not per-expense custom splits)
- No authentication (public API)
- Floating point rounding may cause minor discrepancies

---

**üßÆ Settlement Calculation Logic**
- How does the app figure out who pays whom?
- 1.List all people in the group.
- 2.Calculate each person‚Äôs balance:
-- Balance = Total paid minus total owed.
- 3.Split into two groups:
-- Creditors: People who are owed money (positive balance).
-- Debtors: People who owe money (negative balance).
- 4.While there are both creditors and debtors:
-- Pick the person who owes the most (debtor).
-- Pick the person who is owed the most (creditor).
-- The debtor pays the creditor the smaller of what they owe or what the creditor is owed.
-- Update both balances.
-- If anyone‚Äôs balance becomes zero, remove them from the list.
- 5.Repeat until everyone‚Äôs balance is zero.

[Start]
|
[List all people]
|
[Calculate balances]
|
[Split into Creditors & Debtors]
|
[While both exist]
|
[Pick top Debtor & Creditor]
|
[Debtor pays Creditor]
|
[Update balances]
|
[Remove anyone with zero balance]
|
[Repeat]
|
[All balances zero?]
|
Yes
|
[End: All debts settled!]
